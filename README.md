# Advent of Code 2022

This repo hosts the results for https://adventofcode.com/2022.

Main language is **Typescript** in folder `ts`.

Some days are solved in **Go** as well in folder `golang`.

## Typescript

The puzzles are solved in Typescript using jest and mocha. If all tests pass green, all puzzles
are solved correctly

## Go

The puzzles are solved in Go simply by printing their results. They must be compared with the
expected results manually.
